  ## Description: 
  This is a basic task application that allows users to store tasks in Kanban format with “To Do”, “In Progress”, “In Review”, and “Done” lists. As a user makes a task, they create a due date. When the due date is approaching, the task background will turn yellow. If a due date is passed, the background will turn red. These tasks are draggable from one list to the other and stored in local storage for later use. 

  ## Installation: 
  To install, simply clone this GitHub repository to your computer. You also have the option to access the app through the GitHub pages link: https://ancs214.github.io/taskmaster-pro/

  ## Usage: 
  Simply click “Add Task”, create your task, and pick a due date. It will auto-populate to the “To Do” list, then you can drag and drop the task to any list you’d like. There is an option to delete all tasks on the left if you want to start over, or you can select specific tasks to drag to the bottom trash.
