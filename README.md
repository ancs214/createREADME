  ## Description: 
  This is an application that allows developers to create a README file for their project using the command line. As developers, we have so many different Github repositories…but one important thing they all have in common is the README file. It can be a pain to continuously make these files over and over again. This app dynamically generates a README file from the user’s input using the Inquirer npm.

  ## Installation: 
  For installation, simply clone or fork the repository code to your computer. 

  ## Usage: 
  Type “node index” in the command line to initialize the application. Answer the prompts to create the README sections. After you’re done answering the prompts, a README file will be created under newREADME.md! Copy and paste or drag the file into the README section in your Github repository.
